## UX (User Experience)

### User Stories
1. **As a user,** I want to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a friend or the computer so I can have fun and challenge myself.
2. **As a user,** I want the option to select the difficulty level when playing against the computer to match my skill level.
3. **As a user,** I want a responsive design so I can play the game on any device.
4. **As a user,** I want a visually appealing interface to enhance my gaming experience.
5. **As a user,** I want quick access to instructions and a main menu to easily navigate the game.

## Strategy
The goal of this project was to create a fun and interactive game using JavaScript. The focus was on user engagement, responsive design, and implementing ai logic for the computer opponent.

## Scope

- "Player vs Player" mode.
- A responsive and interactive UI with clear visual feedback.

## Structural
The game is structured into:
- A main menu for navigation.
- The game board for playing.
- Interactive modals for instructions and about information.

## Skeleton (Wireframes)
Initial wireframes were designed for desktop, tablet, and mobile views to ensure a consistent experience. These included layouts for the main menu, game board, and modals.
