## UX (User Experience)
### User Stories
1. **As a user,** I want to play Tic-Tac-Toe against a friend or the computer so I can have fun and challenge myself.
2. **As a user,** I want the option to select the difficulty level when playing against the computer to match my skill level.
3. **As a user,** I want a responsive design so I can play the game on any device.
4. **As a user,** I want a visually appealing interface to enhance my gaming experience.
5. **As a user,** I want quick access to instructions and a main menu to easily navigate the game.
## Strategy
The goal of this project was to create a fun and interactive game using JavaScript. The focus was on user engagement, responsive design, and implementing advanced logic for the computer opponent.
## Scope
Row Rumble includes:
- "Player vs Player" mode.
- "Player vs Computer" mode
- A responsive and interactive UI with clear visual feedback.
## Structural
The game is structured into:
- A main menu for navigation.
- The game board for playing.
- A scoreboard for keeping record of wins and losses.
## Skeleton (Wireframes)
Initial wireframes were designed for desktop, tablet, and mobile views to ensure a consistent experience. These included layouts for the main menu, game board, and modals.
